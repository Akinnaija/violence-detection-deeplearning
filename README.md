The article addresses the problem of detecting violent actions in videos, analyzing the state of the art of various deep learning models and developing a new one. Our aim is to develop a new neural network model capable of reaching or exceeding the state of the art.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in Python using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries to develop the model.

## Results

The following bar graph shows a comparison of our model with other neural models. In it you can see how our model reaches the state of the art, positioning itself as one of the best models in terms of test accuracy.

## Evaluation

We provide a [Jupyter Notebook](ViolenceActionDetection.ipynb) with instructions to training and testing our model also we provide links to download the datasets.
