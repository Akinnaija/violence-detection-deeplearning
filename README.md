Violence detection using deep learning<br/>
Fenando José Rendón Segador, Juan Antonio Álvarez-García, Fernando Enriquez, Oscar Deniz

The article addresses the problem of detecting violent actions in videos, analyzing the state of the art of various deep learning models and developing a new one. Our aim is to develop a new neural network model capable of reaching or exceeding the state of the art.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in Python using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries to develop the model.
